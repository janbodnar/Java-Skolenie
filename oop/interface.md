# Interface

An interface defines a contract that must be implemented by classes that extend  
the interface.  

A remote control is an interface between the viewer and the TV. It is an  
interface to this electronic device. Diplomatic protocol guides all activities  
in the diplomatic field. Rules of the road are rules that motorists, bikers, and  
pedestrians must follow. Interfaces in programming are analogous to the previous  
examples.  

Interfaces are:

- APIs
- Contracts

Objects interact with the outside world with the methods they expose. The actual  
implementation is not important to the programmer, or it also might be secret. A  
company might sell a library and it does not want to disclose the actual  
implementation. A programmer might call a maximize method on a window of a GUI  
toolkit but knows nothing about how this method is implemented. From this point  
of view, interfaces are ways through which objects interact with the outside  
world, without exposing too much about their inner workings.  

From the second point of view, interfaces are contracts. They are used to design  
an architecture of an application and help organize the code.  

Interfaces are fully abstract types. They are declared using the interface  
keyword. In Java, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class that can  
contain only constants, method signatures, and nested types. There are no method  
bodies. Interfaces cannot be instantiated—they can only be implemented by  
classes or extended by other interfaces.  

All interface members implicitly have public access. Interfaces cannot have  
fully implemented methods. A Java class may implement any number of interfaces.  
An interface scan also extend any number of interfaces. A class that implements  
an interface must implement all method signatures of an interface.  

Interfaces are used to simulate multiple inheritance. A Java class can inherit  
only from one class but it can implement multiple interfaces. Multiple  
inheritance with interfaces is not about inheriting methods and variables, it is  
about inheriting ideas or contracts which are described by the interfaces.  

The body of the interface contains abstract methods, but since all methods in an  
interface are, by definition, abstract, the abstract keyword is not required.  
Since an interface specifies a set of exposed behaviors, all methods are  
implicitly public. An interface can contain constant member declarations in  
addition to method declarations. All constant values defined in an interface are  
implicitly public, static, and final. These modifiers can be omitted.  

There is one important distinction between interfaces and abstract classes.  
Abstract classes provide partial implementation for classes that are related in  
the inheritance hierarchy. Interfaces on the other hand can be implemented by  
classes that are not related to each other.  

## Simple example

The following is a simple program which uses an interface.

```java
package com.zetcode;

interface IInfo {

    void doInform();
}

class Some implements IInfo {

    @Override
    public void doInform() {

        System.out.println("This is Some Class");
    }
}

public class SimpleInterface {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Some sm = new Some();
        sm.doInform();
    }
}
```

We have one interface and one class which implements the interface.

```java
interface IInfo {

    void doInform();
}
```

This is an interface `IInfo`. It has the doInform method signature.

```java
class Some implements IInfo {
```

We implement the `IInfo` interface. To implement a specific interface, we use  
the implements keyword.  

```java
@Override
public void doInform() {

    System.out.println("This is Some Class");
}
```

The class provides an implementation for the `doInform` method. The` @Override`  
annotation tells the compiler that we are overriding a method.  

## Multiple interfaces

Java does not allow to inherit from more than one class directly. It allows to  
implement multiple interfaces. The next example shows how a class can implement  
multiple interfaces.  

```java
package com.zetcode;

interface Device {

    void switchOn();

    void switchOff();
}

interface Volume {

    void volumeUp();

    void volumeDown();
}

interface Pluggable {

    void plugIn();

    void plugOff();
}

class CellPhone implements Device, Volume, Pluggable {

    @Override
    public void switchOn() {

        System.out.println("Switching on");
    }

    @Override
    public void switchOff() {

        System.out.println("Switching on");
    }

    @Override
    public void volumeUp() {

        System.out.println("Volume up");
    }

    @Override
    public void volumeDown() {

        System.out.println("Volume down");
    }

    @Override
    public void plugIn() {

        System.out.println("Plugging in");
    }

    @Override
    public void plugOff() {

        System.out.println("Plugging off");
    }
}

public class MultipleInterfaces {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CellPhone cp = new CellPhone();
        cp.switchOn();
        cp.volumeUp();
        cp.plugIn();
    }
}
```

We have a `CellPhone` class that inherits from three interfaces.  

```java
class CellPhone implements Device, Volume, Pluggable {
```
 
The class implements all three interfaces which are divided by a comma. The  
`CellPhone` class must implement all method signatures from all three interfaces.  


## Interface hierarchy

The next example shows how interfaces can form a hierarchy. Interfaces can  
inherit from other interfaces using the `extends` keyword.  

```java
package com.zetcode;

interface IInfo {

    void doInform();
}

interface IVersion {

    void getVersion();
}

interface ILog extends IInfo, IVersion {

    void doLog();
}

class DBConnect implements ILog {

    @Override
    public void doInform() {

        System.out.println("This is DBConnect class");
    }

    @Override
    public void getVersion() {

        System.out.println("Version 1.02");
    }

    @Override
    public void doLog() {

        System.out.println("Logging");
    }

    public void connect() {

        System.out.println("Connecting to the database");
    }
}

public class InterfaceHierarchy {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        DBConnect db = new DBConnect();
        db.doInform();
        db.getVersion();
        db.doLog();
        db.connect();
    }
}
```

We define three interfaces. The interfaces are organized in a hierarchy.

```java
interface ILog extends IInfo, IVersion {
```

The `ILog` interface inherits from two interfaces.

```java
class DBConnect implements ILog {
```

The `DBConnect` class implements the `ILog` interface. Therefore it must  
implement the methods of all three interfaces.  

@Override
public void doInform() {

    System.out.println("This is DBConnect class");
}

The `DBConnect` class implements the `doInform` method. This method was  
inherited by the `ILog` interface which the class implements.
