# YAML

**YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is often  
used for configuration files, data interchange, and storing structured data. 

## Key characteristics of YAML:

* **Human-readable:** YAML syntax is designed to be easily understood by humans, making it  
  a good choice for configuration files and data interchange.  
* **Flexible:** YAML supports a variety of data types, including scalars, sequences,  
  mappings, and even custom types.  
* **Compact:** YAML syntax is often more concise than XML or JSON, making it suitable  
  for storing large amounts of data.  
* **Versatile:** YAML can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple configuration  
  files to complex data structures.  

## Basic YAML syntax:

* **Scalars:** Simple values, such as strings, numbers, booleans, or null.
  ```yaml
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  is_active: true
  ```
* **Sequences:** Ordered lists of values.
  ```yaml
  fruits:
    - apple
    - banana
    - orange
  ```
* **Mappings:** Key-value pairs.
  ```yaml
  person:
    name: Alice
    age: 25
    address:
      street: Main Street
      city: New York
  ```


YAML is commonly used in various contexts:

* **Configuration files:** For storing settings and preferences for applications.
* **Data interchange:** For exchanging data between different systems.
* **Serialization:** For storing and retrieving structured data.
* **Automation tools:** For defining tasks and workflows.

Overall, YAML is a versatile and easy-to-use language that is well-suited for a variety of data-related tasks.
